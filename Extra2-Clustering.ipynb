    "## Average Linkage Clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "The first alternative clustering algorithm we will be looking at is Average Linkage Clustering. Both Average-Linkage Clustering and Single-Linkage Clustering are subtypes of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The difference between these two clustering methods is the definition of 'shortest distance'. Note that in our earlier example, correlation between stocks was used to represent similarities. We can think of correlation as the inverse of 'distance' between the nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In single-linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is determined by a single element pair (one from each cluster) which are closest to each other. The algorithm always chooses the shortest of these links while merging two clusters. While merging cluster, single-linkage clustering disregards the distance to all other elements in the cluster. Therefore, it tends to produce large cluster where ceertain pairs of elements are dissimilar to each other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in average-linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the average of all distances between pairs of objects in the two clusters. This helps to prevent the so-called chaining phenomenon experienced by single-linkage clustering, where many of the elements in each cluster may be very dissimilar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following section includes the Python code in performing average-linkage clustering using scikit-learn. Since the scikit-learn function requires a distance matrix, we will need to convert the correlation matrix into distance matrix.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the correlation matrix into distance matrix. Correlation is within the interval [-1, 1] and a higher value reflects greater similarity. We'll need to transform correlation value into distance, hence we get the absolute value of (correlation - 1). The resulting value will be a distance within interval [0, 2] and a higher value reflects lower similarity.  \n"

    "## K-Means Clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "The second clustering algorithm we use is K-Means Clustering. To use K-Means clustering, we need to define the \"features\" of each node. Correlation only provides the distance between each node and hence is not sufficient for K-Means clustering. In this case, we define the features to be daily price change (in percentage) of each individual stock. This information is contained in the daily return matrix where each column contains the daily price change in terms of percentage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means clustering attempts to fit K number of centroids to the dataset such that the total sum of distance from each node to its corresponding centroid is minimised. One characterisitc of K-Means clustering is that it tends to separate data into clusters of roughly equal size. In other words, it assumes the data distribution to be separable with K spherical clusters. This might not work well on certain data where this assumption does not hold true.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, since K-Means clustering assumes the data to be separable using K spherical clusters of roughly equal size, the choice of K value is key. A bad choice of K can lead to bad results. We will explore this in later section.  \n",

    "### Python Code  \n",
